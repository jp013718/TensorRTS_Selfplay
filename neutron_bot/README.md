# Creating a Bot to Use for Tournament
In order to use your trained model in a tournament-ready bot, copy this directory and all files in it. You can copy all files from your trained checkpoint into the directory `neutron_checkpoint`. Further, you will want to edit at least the string returned by `student_name_hook()` in `agent.py` to be your name. Additionally, give your bot a unique name (i.e., change the name of the class NeutronBot to something else and ensure the name is consistent among file and directory names). Finally, the directory can be dropped into the `bots` folder in the RL4SE repo, located at `RL4SE/enn/TensorRTS/bots`. Currently, the implementation of a main and training functions located in that repo are still being worked on. The instructions and examples here will be updated as those issues are resolved.
